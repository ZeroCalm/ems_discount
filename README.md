Code 4 Discounts

THis application (WORK IN PROGRESS), will provide location information via Google.maps API, of food locations that provide discounts to EMS providers.  

Currently, the map shows five locations in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties with Google's information window providing location specifics.

In the near future there will be two maps.  

  1.  First Map, will allow users to click on locations, provide information about the discounts offered and save that location and information to the database.

  2.  User Generated Content.  The Second map will show all locations added to the database with discount information.
